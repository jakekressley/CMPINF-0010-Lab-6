Labs 6 and 7 Repository

Our repository asks the name and age of the user, and prints a statement declaring if they can drink legally.

# Liscense

Our project is MIT licensed. We believe this is a good license to have because it allows people that obtained a copy from the original user to manipulate the project. We also have a liability clause at the end of our license. The link to the license--> [here](https://jupyterhub.sci.pitt.edu/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/CMPINF-0010-Lab-6/LICENCE)

# Code of Conduct

We decided to use the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. We chose this because it is widely used and clarifies unspoken rules that everyone should follow to provide everyone with a safe, welcoming environment. The link to code of conduct --> [here](https://jupyterhub.sci.pitt.edu/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/CMPINF-0010-Lab-6/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

# Contributing

The code presented should be an accurate way to check if someone is above or below the legal drinking age. If that changes, anyone who possesses a copy of the repository may go in and update the age checker. In addition to making changes in the code, one can add code to maybe test if they can drink legally in different places around the world. If any changes are made, they are expected to be proofread and checked to make sure the code runs properly.
